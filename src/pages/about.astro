        <h1>Steele Shreve</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a senior IT student at the <a
            href="https://uc.edu/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Cincinnati</a
        >, expecting to graduate in May 2025. My coursework is heavily
            focused on programming and software engineering, and I've had the
            chance to apply what I've learned during internships at <a
            href="https://milwaukeetool.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Milwaukee Tool</a
        > and <a
            href="https://183degrees.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">183Â°</a
        >.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm primarily interested in full-stack web development, and my tech
            stack of choice is Go, HTMX, and PostgreSQL. I have a passion for
            continuous learning, and working in software allows me to experiment
            with new technologies and tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I love traveling and experiencing life. I enjoy
            nature, staying active with fitness and sports, and reading books
            and watching movies.
