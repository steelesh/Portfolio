description: Reasons why Steele's pursuing his interest in the Go programming language
---

Recently, I've written some programs in [Go](https://go.dev), and I've really enjoyed it.

Go's syntax is simple, concise, and readable. Its great standard library and package system allow for building with
minimal friction. It's also highly performant.

Most importantly, I find it rewarding to write code in Go, and it motivates me to keep learning more and improving my
skills.

## More on Go

Rob Pike, a co-creator of the Go programming language, has a [great article](https://go.dev/talks/2012/splash.article)
where he discusses the motivations and design considerations behind Go, addressing the real-world problems faced at
Google at the time.
